            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THE burden of the word of the L<span>ord</span> to Israel by Malachi.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 I have loved you, saith the L<span>ord</span>. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? <i>Was</i> not Esau Jacob&rsquo;s brother? saith the L<span>ord</span>: yet I loved Jacob,</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the L<span>ord</span> hath indignation for ever.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The L<span>ord</span> will be magnified from the border of Israel.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; A son honoureth <i>his</i> father, and a servant his master: if then I <i>be</i> a father, where <i>is</i> mine honour? and if I <i>be</i> a master, where <i>is</i> my fear? saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> contemptible.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, <i>is</i> <i>it</i> not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, <i>is</i> <i>it</i> not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Who <i>is</i> <i>there</i> even among you that would shut the doors <i>for</i> <i>nought?</i> neither do ye kindle <i>fire</i> on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> great among the heathen, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> polluted; and the fruit thereof, <i>even</i> his meat, <i>is</i> contemptible.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness <i>is</i> <i>it!</i> and ye have snuffed at it, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts; and ye brought <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>was</i> torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 But cursed <i>be</i> the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I <i>am</i> a great King, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, and my name <i>is</i> dreadful among the heathen.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND now, O ye priests, this commandment <i>is</i> for you.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay <i>it</i> to heart, to give glory unto my name, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, I will even send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I have cursed them already, because ye do not lay <i>it</i> to heart.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your faces, <i>even</i> the dung of your solemn feasts; and <i>one</i> shall take you away with it.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him <i>for</i> the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did turn many away from iniquity.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 For the priest&rsquo;s lips should keep knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth: for he <i>is</i> the messenger of the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned the holiness of the L<span>ord</span> which he loved, and hath married the daughter of a strange god.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 The L<span>ord</span> will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth an offering unto the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the L<span>ord</span> with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth <i>it</i> with good will at your hand.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the L<span>ord</span> hath been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast dealt treacherously: yet <i>is</i> she thy companion, and the wife of thy covenant.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit. And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 For the L<span>ord</span>, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting away: for <i>one</i> covereth violence with his garment, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye deal not treacherously.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; Ye have wearied the L<span>ord</span> with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein have we wearied <i>him?</i> When ye say, Every one that doeth evil <i>is</i> good in the sight of the L<span>ord</span>, and he delighteth in them; or, Where <i>is</i> the God of judgment?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>BEHOLD, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he <i>is</i> like a refiner&rsquo;s fire, and like fullers&rsquo; soap:</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And he shall sit <i>as</i> a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the L<span>ord</span> an offering in righteousness.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the L<span>ord</span>, as in the days of old, and as in former years.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and against false swearers, and against those that oppress the hireling in <i>his</i> wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger <i>from</i> <i>his</i> <i>right</i>, and fear not me, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For I <i>am</i> the L<span>ord</span>, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine ordinances, and have not kept <i>them</i>. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts. But ye said, Wherein shall we return?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Ye <i>are</i> cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, <i>even</i> this whole nation.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that <i>there</i> <i>shall</i> not <i>be</i> <i>room</i> enough <i>to</i> <i>receive</i> <i>it</i>.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; Your words have been stout against me, saith the L<span>ord</span>. Yet ye say, What have we spoken <i>so</i> <i>much</i> against thee?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Ye have said, It <i>is</i> vain to serve God: and what profit <i>is</i> <i>it</i> that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the L<span>ord</span> of hosts?</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set up; yea, <i>they</i> <i>that</i> tempt God are even delivered.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; Then they that feared the L<span>ord</span> spake often one to another: and the L<span>ord</span> hearkened, and heard <i>it</i>, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the L<span>ord</span>, and that thought upon his name.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And they shall be mine, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, in that day when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man spareth his own son that serveth him.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth him not.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 &para; But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and grow up as calves of the stall.</span></p>
