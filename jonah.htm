<p style="color: #000000; text-align: center;" data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter1" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now the word of the L<span class="lord">ord</span> came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it, to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; But the L<span class="lord">ord</span> sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be broken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his god, and cast forth the wares that <i>were</i> in the ship into the sea, to lighten <i>it</i> of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil <i>is</i> upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose cause this evil <i>is</i> upon us; What <i>is</i> thine occupation? and whence comest thou? what <i>is</i> thy country? and of what people <i>art</i> thou?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And he said unto them, I <i>am</i> an Hebrew; and I fear the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry <i>land</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, because he had told them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest <i>is</i> upon you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring <i>it</i> to the land; but they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Wherefore they cried unto the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, and said, We beseech thee, O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man&rsquo;s life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, hast done as it pleased thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 So they took up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and the sea ceased from her raging.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Then the men feared the L<span class="lord">ord</span> exceedingly, and offered a sacrifice unto the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, and made vows.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; Now the L<span class="lord">ord</span> had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah. And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Then Jonah prayed unto the L<span class="lord">ord</span> his God out of the fish&rsquo;s belly,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, <i>and</i> thou heardest my voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 The waters compassed me about, <i>even</i> to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars <i>was</i> about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O L<span class="lord">ord</span> my God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the L<span class="lord">ord</span>: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay <i>that</i> that I have vowed. Salvation <i>is</i> of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And the L<span class="lord">ord</span> spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry <i>land</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And the word of the L<span class="lord">ord</span> came unto Jonah the second time, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days&rsquo; journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day&rsquo;s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered <i>him</i> with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And he caused <i>it</i> to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that <i>is</i> in their hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Who can tell <i>if</i> God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did <i>it</i> not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter4" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And he prayed unto the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, and said, I pray thee, O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, <i>was</i> not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou <i>art</i> a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Therefore now, O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for <i>it</i> <i>is</i> better for me to die than to live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; Then said the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, Doest thou well to be angry?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And the L<span class="lord">ord</span> God prepared a gourd, and made <i>it</i> to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, <i>It</i> <i>is</i> better for me to die than to live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, <i>even</i> unto death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Then said the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night:</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and <i>also</i> much cattle?</span> </p>
