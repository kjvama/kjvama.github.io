            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>2 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>3 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>4 To Titus, <i>mine</i> own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>6 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>7 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>8 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>9 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>10 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>11 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre’s sake.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>12 One of themselves, <i>even</i> a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians <i>are</i> alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>13 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>14 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>15 Unto the pure all things <i>are</i> pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving <i>is</i> nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>16 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny <i>him</i>, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</span></p>

                <p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span class="bookname">TITUS</span>&nbsp;<span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>1 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>2 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>3 The aged women likewise, that <i>they be</i> in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>4 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>5 <i>To be</i> discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>6 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>7 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine <i>shewing</i> uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>8 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>9 <i>Exhort</i> servants to be obedient unto their own masters, <i>and</i> to please <i>them</i> well in all <i>things</i>; not answering again;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>10 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>11 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>12 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>13 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>14 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>15 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span class="bookname">TITUS</span>&nbsp;<span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>1 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>2 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, <i>but</i> gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>3 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, <i>and</i> hating one another.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>4 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>6 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>7 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>8 <i>This is</i> a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and profitable unto men.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>9 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>10 A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>11 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>13 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>14 And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"><span>15 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace <i>be</i> with you all. Amen.</span></p>
