<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the L<span>ord</span>, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for <i>it</i> <i>was</i> well with us in Egypt: therefore the L<span>ord</span> will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 &para; And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the L<span>ord</span>, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And the L<span>ord</span> came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that <i>was</i> upon him, and gave <i>it</i> unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, <i>that</i>, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 But there remained two <i>of</i> <i>the</i> men in the camp, the name of the one <i>was</i> Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they <i>were</i> of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, <i>one</i> of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s people were prophets, <i>and</i> that the L<span>ord</span> would put his spirit upon them!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 &para; And there went forth a wind from the L<span>ord</span>, and brought quails from the sea, and let <i>them</i> fall by the camp, as it were a day&rsquo;s journey on this side, and as it were a day&rsquo;s journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits <i>high</i> upon the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And the people stood up all that day, and all <i>that</i> night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread <i>them</i> all abroad for themselves round about the camp.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And while the flesh <i>was</i> yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the L<span>ord</span> was kindled against the people, and the L<span>ord</span> smote the people with a very great plague.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 <i>And</i> the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And they said, Hath the L<span>ord</span> indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? And the L<span>ord</span> heard <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 (Now the man Moses <i>was</i> very meek, above all the men which <i>were</i> upon the face of the earth.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And the L<span>ord</span> spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And the L<span>ord</span> came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood <i>in</i> the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 My servant Moses <i>is</i> not so, who <i>is</i> faithful in all mine house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the L<span>ord</span> shall he behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the anger of the L<span>ord</span> was kindled against them; and he departed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam <i>became</i> leprous, <i>white</i> as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, <i>she</i> <i>was</i> leprous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have sinned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he cometh out of his mother&rsquo;s womb.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in <i>again</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the wilderness of Paran.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And Moses by the commandment of the L<span>ord</span> sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men <i>were</i> heads of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And these <i>were</i> their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 &para; So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, <i>were</i>. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and <i>they</i> <i>brought</i> of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Nevertheless the people <i>be</i> strong that dwell in the land, and the cities <i>are</i> walled, <i>and</i> very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, <i>which</i> <i>come</i> of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And wherefore hath the L<span>ord</span> brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, <i>is</i> an exceeding good land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 If the L<span>ord</span> delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Only rebel not ye against the L<span>ord</span>, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they <i>are</i> bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> with us: fear them not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the L<span>ord</span> appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; And Moses said unto the L<span>ord</span>, Then the Egyptians shall hear <i>it</i>, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And they will tell <i>it</i> to the inhabitants of this land: <i>for</i> they have heard that thou L<span>ord</span> <i>art</i> among this people, that thou L<span>ord</span> art seen face to face, and <i>that</i> thy cloud standeth over them, and <i>that</i> thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; Now <i>if</i> thou shalt kill <i>all</i> this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Because the L<span>ord</span> was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 The L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing <i>the</i> <i>guilty</i>, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth <i>generation</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And the L<span>ord</span> said, I have pardoned according to thy word:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 How long <i>shall</i> <i>I</i> <i>bear</i> <i>with</i> this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, <i>concerning</i> which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 But <i>as</i> <i>for</i> you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, <i>even</i> forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, <i>even</i> forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 I the L<span>ord</span> have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, <i>which</i> <i>were</i> of the men that went to search the land, lived <i>still</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 &para; And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we <i>be</i> <i>here</i>, and will go up unto the place which the L<span>ord</span> hath promised: for we have sinned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the L<span>ord</span>? but it shall not prosper.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>42 Go not up, for the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites <i>are</i> there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the L<span>ord</span>, therefore the L<span>ord</span> will not be with you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span>, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, <i>even</i> unto Hormah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said unto them, <i>Ye</i> <i>take</i> too much upon you, seeing all the congregation <i>are</i> holy, every one of them, and the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the L<span>ord</span>?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And when Moses heard <i>it</i>, he fell upon his face:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the L<span>ord</span>, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the L<span>ord</span>, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the L<span>ord</span> every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each <i>of</i> <i>you</i> his censer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the L<span>ord</span> appeared unto all the congregation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the L<span>ord</span> hath sent me to do all these works; for <i>I</i> <i>have</i> not <i>done</i> <i>them</i> of mine own mind.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And all Israel that <i>were</i> round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up <i>also</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 And there came out a fire from the L<span>ord</span>, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad <i>plates</i> <i>for</i> a covering of the altar:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 &para; But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the L<span>ord</span> appeared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>46 &para; And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the L<span>ord</span>; the plague is begun.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, <i>even</i> the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: <i>it</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer <i>as</i> an heave offering unto the L<span>ord</span>, I have given to the Levites to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an heave offering of it for the L<span>ord</span>, <i>even</i> a tenth <i>part</i> of the tithe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And <i>this</i> your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though <i>it</i> <i>were</i> the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the L<span>ord</span> of all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall give thereof the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s heave offering to Aaron the priest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the L<span>ord</span>, of all the best thereof, <i>even</i> the hallowed part thereof out of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the L<span>ord</span>!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the L<span>ord</span> into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the L<span>ord</span> appeared unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And Moses took the rod from before the L<span>ord</span>, as he commanded him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts <i>also</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink <i>of</i> the water of the wells: we will go by the king&rsquo;s <i>high</i> way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without <i>doing</i> any thing <i>else</i>, go through on my feet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And Moses did as the L<span>ord</span> commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the L<span>ord</span>, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And the L<span>ord</span> hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no bread, neither <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> water; and our soul loatheth this light bread.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And the L<span>ord</span> sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and much people of Israel died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the L<span>ord</span>, and against thee; pray unto the L<span>ord</span>, that he take away the serpents from us.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon <i>is</i> the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the L<span>ord</span>, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And from thence <i>they</i> <i>went</i> to Beer: that <i>is</i> the well whereof the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them water.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by <i>the</i> <i>direction</i> <i>of</i> the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness <i>they</i> <i>went</i> to Mattanah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And from Bamoth <i>in</i> the valley, that <i>is</i> in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 &para; And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink <i>of</i> the waters of the well: <i>but</i> we will go along by the king&rsquo;s <i>high</i> way, until we be past thy borders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon <i>was</i> strong.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 For Heshbon <i>was</i> the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, <i>and</i> the lords of the high places of Arnon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 &para; Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof, and drove out the Amorites that <i>were</i> there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 &para; And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the L<span>ord</span> shall speak unto me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent unto me, <i>saying</i>,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they <i>are</i> blessed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the L<span>ord</span> refuseth to give me leave to go with you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the L<span>ord</span> my God, to do less or more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the L<span>ord</span> will say unto me more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, <i>and</i> go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 &para; And God&rsquo;s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the L<span>ord</span> stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants <i>were</i> with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And the ass saw the angel of the L<span>ord</span> standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 But the angel of the L<span>ord</span> stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall <i>being</i> on this side, and a wall on that side.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And when the ass saw the angel of the L<span>ord</span>, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam&rsquo;s foot against the wall: and he smote her again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And the angel of the L<span>ord</span> went further, and stood in a narrow place, where <i>was</i> no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And when the ass saw the angel of the L<span>ord</span>, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam&rsquo;s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And the L<span>ord</span> opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And the ass said unto Balaam, <i>Am</i> not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since <i>I</i> <i>was</i> thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 Then the L<span>ord</span> opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the L<span>ord</span> standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And the angel of the L<span>ord</span> said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because <i>thy</i> way is perverse before me:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the L<span>ord</span>, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 And the angel of the L<span>ord</span> said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 &para; And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which <i>is</i> in the border of Arnon, which <i>is</i> in the utmost coast.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that <i>were</i> with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost <i>part</i> of the people.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the L<span>ord</span> in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>48 &para; And the officers which <i>were</i> over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the L<span>ord</span>, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, <i>even</i> all wrought jewels.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, <i>for</i> a memorial for the children of Israel before the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter32" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 32</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place <i>was</i> a place for cattle;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 <i>Even</i> the country which the L<span>ord</span> smote before the congregation of Israel, <i>is</i> a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, <i>and</i> bring us not over Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the L<span>ord</span> hath given them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the L<span>ord</span> had given them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, that had done evil in the sight of the L<span>ord</span>, was consumed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers&rsquo; stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the L<span>ord</span> toward Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan eastward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the L<span>ord</span> to war,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the L<span>ord</span>, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And the land be subdued before the L<span>ord</span>: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the L<span>ord</span>, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the L<span>ord</span>: and be sure your sin will find you out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the L<span>ord</span> to battle, as my lord saith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 <i>So</i> all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> forty and eight cities: them <i>shall</i> <i>ye</i> <i>give</i> with their suburbs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Moses, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 These six cities shall be a refuge, <i>both</i> for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Or <i>if</i> he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may die, and he die, he <i>is</i> a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of wait, that he die;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote <i>him</i> shall surely be put to death; <i>for</i> he <i>is</i> a murderer: the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was anointed with the holy oil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 So these <i>things</i> shall be for a statute of judgment unto you throughout your generations in all your dwellings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person <i>to</i> <i>cause</i> <i>him</i> to die.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which <i>is</i> guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye <i>are:</i> for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein I dwell: for I the L<span>ord</span> dwell among the children of Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And they said, The L<span>ord</span> commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the L<span>ord</span> to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the <i>other</i> tribes of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the L<span>ord</span>, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 This <i>is</i> the thing which the L<span>ord</span> doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from <i>one</i> tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Even as the L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father&rsquo;s brothers&rsquo; sons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 <i>And</i> they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 These <i>are</i> the commandments and the judgments, which the L<span>ord</span> commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan <i>near</i> Jericho.</span> </p>
