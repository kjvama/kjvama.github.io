<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And he brought Aaron&rsquo;s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that <i>was</i> before the L<span>ord</span>, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put <i>them</i> on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And he put all upon Aaron&rsquo;s hands, and upon his sons&rsquo; hands, and waved them <i>for</i> a wave offering before the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt <i>them</i> on the altar upon the burnt offering: they <i>were</i> consecrations for a sweet savour: it <i>is</i> an offering made by fire unto the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it <i>for</i> a wave offering before the L<span>ord</span>: <i>for</i> of the ram of consecration it was Moses&rsquo; part; as the L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which <i>was</i> upon the altar, and sprinkled <i>it</i> upon Aaron, <i>and</i> upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons&rsquo; garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, <i>and</i> his garments, and his sons, and his sons&rsquo; garments with him.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron <i>which</i> <i>were</i> left <i>alive</i>, saying,</span></p>
