<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchi-shua, the sons of Saul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on the sword, and died.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And when all the men of Israel that <i>were</i> in the valley saw that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in mount Gilboa.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; And when all Jabesh-gilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against the L<span>ord</span>, <i>even</i> against the word of the L<span>ord</span>, which he kept not, and also for asking <i>counsel</i> of <i>one</i> <i>that</i> <i>had</i> a familiar spirit, to inquire <i>of</i> <i>it;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And inquired not of the L<span>ord</span>: therefore he slew him, and turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter11" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 11</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron, saying, Behold, we <i>are</i> thy bone and thy flesh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou <i>wast</i> he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the L<span>ord</span> thy God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be ruler over my people Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron; and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the L<span>ord</span>; and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the L<span>ord</span> by Samuel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which <i>is</i> Jebus; where the Jebusites <i>were</i>, the inhabitants of the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which <i>is</i> the city of David.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up, and was chief.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the city of David.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 So David waxed greater and greater: for the L<span>ord</span> of hosts <i>was</i> with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; These also <i>are</i> the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, <i>and</i> with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the L<span>ord</span> concerning Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And this <i>is</i> the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain <i>by</i> <i>him</i> at one time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And after him <i>was</i> Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who <i>was</i> <i>one</i> of the three mighties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And they set themselves in the midst of <i>that</i> parcel, and delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the L<span>ord</span> saved <i>them</i> by a great deliverance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And David <i>was</i> then in the hold, and the Philistines&rsquo; garrison <i>was</i> then at Beth-lehem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Beth-lehem, that <i>is</i> at the gate!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Beth-lehem, that <i>was</i> by the gate, and took <i>it</i>, and brought <i>it</i> to David: but David would not drink <i>of</i> it, but poured it out to the L<span>ord</span>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing: shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? for with <i>the</i> <i>jeopardy</i> <i>of</i> their lives they brought it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three: for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew <i>them</i>, and had a name among the three.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was their captain: howbeit he attained not to the <i>first</i> three.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of <i>great</i> stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand <i>was</i> a spear like a weaver&rsquo;s beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian&rsquo;s hand, and slew him with his own spear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 These <i>things</i> did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not to the <i>first</i> three: and David set him over his guard.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 These <i>were</i> of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of the least <i>was</i> over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 These <i>are</i> they that went over Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all <i>them</i> of the valleys, <i>both</i> toward the east, and toward the west.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And there fell <i>some</i> of Manasseh to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to <i>the</i> <i>jeopardy</i> <i>of</i> our heads.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 For at <i>that</i> time day by day there came to David to help him, until <i>it</i> <i>was</i> a great host, like the host of God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 &para; And these <i>are</i> the numbers of the bands <i>that</i> <i>were</i> ready armed to the war, <i>and</i> came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear <i>were</i> six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And Jehoiada <i>was</i> the leader of the Aaronites, and with him <i>were</i> three thousand and seven hundred;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father&rsquo;s house twenty and two captains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of Saul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make David king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And of the children of Issachar, <i>which</i> <i>were</i> <i>men</i> that had understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do; the heads of them <i>were</i> two hundred; and all their brethren <i>were</i> at their commandment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: <i>they</i> <i>were</i> not of double heart.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel: and all the rest also of Israel <i>were</i> of one heart to make David king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 Moreover they that were nigh them, <i>even</i> unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, <i>and</i> meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for <i>there</i> <i>was</i> joy in Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter13" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 13</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds, <i>and</i> with every leader.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If <i>it</i> <i>seem</i> good unto you, and <i>that</i> <i>it</i> <i>be</i> of the L<span>ord</span> our God, let us send abroad unto our brethren every where, <i>that</i> <i>are</i> left in all the land of Israel, and with them <i>also</i> to the priests and Levites <i>which</i> <i>are</i> in their cities <i>and</i> suburbs, that they may gather themselves unto us:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we inquired not at it in the days of Saul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the thing was right in the eyes of all the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjath-jearim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, <i>that</i> <i>is</i>, to Kirjath-jearim, which <i>belonged</i> to Judah, to bring up thence the ark of God the L<span>ord</span>, that dwelleth <i>between</i> the cherubims, whose name is called <i>on</i> <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And David and all Israel played before God with all <i>their</i> might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And the anger of the L<span>ord</span> was kindled against Uzza, and he smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he died before God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And David was displeased, because the L<span>ord</span> had made a breach upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perez-uzza to this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God <i>home</i> to me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 So David brought not the ark <i>home</i> to himself to the city of David, but carried it aside into the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obed-edom in his house three months. And the L<span>ord</span> blessed the house of Obed-edom, and all that he had.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter14" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 14</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And David perceived that the L<span>ord</span> had confirmed him king over Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his people Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Now these <i>are</i> the names of <i>his</i> children which he had in Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard <i>of</i> <i>it</i>, and went out against them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And David inquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? and wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And the L<span>ord</span> said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into thine hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 So they came up to Baal-perazim; and David smote them there. Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called the name of that place Baal-perazim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Therefore David inquired again of God; and God said unto him, Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees, <i>that</i> then thou shalt go out to battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the L<span>ord</span> brought the fear of him upon all nations.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter15" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 15</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And <i>David</i> made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them hath the L<span>ord</span> chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister unto him for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the L<span>ord</span> unto his place, which he had prepared for it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twenty:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred and twenty:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren two hundred:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren fourscore:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren an hundred and twelve.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel, and Amminadab,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And said unto them, Ye <i>are</i> the chief of the fathers of the Levites: sanctify yourselves, <i>both</i> ye and your brethren, that ye may bring up the ark of the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel unto <i>the</i> <i>place</i> <i>that</i> I have prepared for it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 For because ye <i>did</i> <i>it</i> not at the first, the L<span>ord</span> our God made a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due order.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded according to the word of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their brethren <i>to</i> <i>be</i> the singers with instruments of musick, psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the voice with joy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And with them their brethren of the second <i>degree</i>, Zechariah, Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the porters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i>were</i> <i>appointed</i> to sound with cymbals of brass;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obed-edom, and Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, <i>was</i> for song: he instructed about the song, because he <i>was</i> skilful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And Berechiah and Elkanah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obed-edom and Jehiah <i>were</i> doorkeepers for the ark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 &para; So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> out of the house of Obed-edom with joy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span>, that they offered seven bullocks and seven rams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And David <i>was</i> clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the master of the song with the singers: David also <i>had</i> upon him an ephod of linen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and harps.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 &para; And it came to pass, <i>as</i> the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> came to the city of David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing: and she despised him in her heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter16" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 16</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a flagon <i>of</i> <i>wine</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And he appointed <i>certain</i> of the Levites to minister before the ark of the L<span>ord</span>, and to record, and to thank and praise the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and Benaiah, and Obed-edom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; Then on that day David delivered first <i>this</i> <i>psalm</i> to thank the L<span>ord</span> into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 <i>Saying</i>, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David returned to bless his house.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter17" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 17</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars, but the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> <i>remaineth</i> under curtains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that <i>is</i> in thine heart; for God <i>is</i> with thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Thou shalt not build me an house to dwell in:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and from <i>one</i> tabernacle <i>to</i> <i>another</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, <i>even</i> from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my people Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that <i>are</i> in the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste them any more, as at the beginning,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And since the time that I commanded judges <i>to</i> <i>be</i> over my people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies. Furthermore I tell thee that the L<span>ord</span> will build thee an house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou must go <i>to</i> <i>be</i> with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took <i>it</i> from <i>him</i> that was before thee:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; And David the king came and sat before the L<span>ord</span>, and said, Who <i>am</i> I, O L<span>ord</span> God, and what <i>is</i> mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And <i>yet</i> this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou hast <i>also</i> spoken of thy servant&rsquo;s house for a great while to come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O L<span>ord</span> God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 What can David <i>speak</i> more to thee for the honour of thy servant? for thou knowest thy servant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 O L<span>ord</span>, for thy servant&rsquo;s sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all <i>these</i> great things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 O L<span>ord</span>, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none like thee, neither <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And what one nation in the earth <i>is</i> like thy people Israel, whom God went to redeem <i>to</i> <i>be</i> his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations from before thy people, whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for ever; and thou, L<span>ord</span>, becamest their God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Therefore now, L<span>ord</span>, let the thing that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established for ever, and do as thou hast said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, saying, The L<span>ord</span> of hosts <i>is</i> the God of Israel, <i>even</i> a God to Israel: and <i>let</i> the house of David thy servant <i>be</i> established before thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build him an house: therefore thy servant hath found <i>in</i> <i>his</i> <i>heart</i> to pray before thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And now, L<span>ord</span>, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou blessest, O L<span>ord</span>, and <i>it</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> blessed for ever.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter18" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 18</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David&rsquo;s servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot <i>horses</i>, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then David put <i>garrisons</i> in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David&rsquo;s servants, <i>and</i> brought gifts. Thus the L<span>ord</span> preserved David whithersoever he went.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to inquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and <i>with</i> <i>him</i> all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Them also king David dedicated unto the L<span>ord</span>, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all <i>these</i> nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David&rsquo;s servants. Thus the L<span>ord</span> preserved David whithersoever he went.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And Joab the son of Zeruiah <i>was</i> over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, <i>were</i> the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada <i>was</i> over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David <i>were</i> chief about the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter19" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 19</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun, Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Wherefore Hanun took David&rsquo;s servants, and shaved them, and cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks, and sent them away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Then there went <i>certain</i>, and told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards be grown, and <i>then</i> return.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syria-maachah, and out of Zobah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba. And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities, and came to battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And when David heard <i>of</i> <i>it</i>, he sent Joab, and all the host of the mighty men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were come <i>were</i> by themselves in the field.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put <i>them</i> in array against the Syrians.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of Abishai his brother, and they set <i>themselves</i> in array against the children of Ammon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then I will help thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the L<span>ord</span> do <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>is</i> good in his sight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 So Joab and the people that <i>were</i> with him drew nigh before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the Syrians that <i>were</i> beyond the river: and Shophach the captain of the host of Hadarezer <i>went</i> before them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed over Jordan, and came upon them, and set <i>the</i> <i>battle</i> in array against them. So when David had put the battle in array against the Syrians, they fought with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand <i>men</i> <i>which</i> <i>fought</i> <i>in</i> chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the children of Ammon any more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter20" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 20</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out <i>to</i> <i>battle</i>, Joab led forth the power of the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and <i>there</i> <i>were</i> precious stones in it; and it was set upon David&rsquo;s head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And he brought out the people that <i>were</i> in it, and cut <i>them</i> with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite slew Sippai, <i>that</i> <i>was</i> of the children of the giant: and they were subdued.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff <i>was</i> like a weaver&rsquo;s beam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of <i>great</i> stature, whose fingers and toes <i>were</i> four and twenty, six <i>on</i> <i>each</i> <i>hand</i>, and six <i>on</i> <i>each</i> <i>foot:</i> and he also was the son of the giant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David&rsquo;s brother slew him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter21" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 21</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go, number Israel from Beer-sheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And Joab answered, The L<span>ord</span> make his people an hundred times so many more as they <i>be:</i> but, my lord the king, <i>are</i> they not all my lord&rsquo;s servants? why then doth my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Nevertheless the king&rsquo;s word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And all <i>they</i> <i>of</i> Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah <i>was</i> four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the king&rsquo;s word was abominable to Joab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, I offer thee three <i>things:</i> choose thee one of them, that I may do <i>it</i> unto thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Choose thee</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Either three years&rsquo; famine; or three months to be destroyed before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies overtaketh <i>thee;</i> or else three days the sword of the L<span>ord</span>, even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the L<span>ord</span> destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall now into the hand of the L<span>ord</span>; for very great <i>are</i> his mercies: but let me not fall into the hand of man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; So the L<span>ord</span> sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was destroying, the L<span>ord</span> beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay now thine hand. And the angel of the L<span>ord</span> stood by the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the L<span>ord</span> stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders <i>of</i> <i>Israel</i>, <i>who</i> <i>were</i> clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And David said unto God, <i>Is</i> <i>it</i> not I <i>that</i> commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but <i>as</i> <i>for</i> these sheep, what have they done? let thine hand, I pray thee, O L<span>ord</span> my God, be on me, and on my father&rsquo;s house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 &para; Then the angel of the L<span>ord</span> commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and set up an altar unto the L<span>ord</span> in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David with <i>his</i> face to the ground.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of <i>this</i> threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the L<span>ord</span>: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And Ornan said unto David, Take <i>it</i> to thee, and let my lord the king do <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>is</i> good in his eyes: lo, I give <i>thee</i> the oxen <i>also</i> for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take <i>that</i> which <i>is</i> thine for the L<span>ord</span>, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And David built there an altar unto the L<span>ord</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the L<span>ord</span>; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And the L<span>ord</span> commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 &para; At that time when David saw that the L<span>ord</span> had answered him in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 For the tabernacle of the L<span>ord</span>, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, <i>were</i> at that season in the high place at Gibeon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 But David could not go before it to inquire of God: for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter22" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 22</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Then David said, This <i>is</i> the house of the L<span>ord</span> God, and this <i>is</i> the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that <i>were</i> in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in abundance without weight;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And David said, Solomon my son <i>is</i> young and tender, and the house <i>that</i> <i>is</i> to be builded for the L<span>ord</span> <i>must</i> <i>be</i> exceeding magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I will <i>therefore</i> now make preparation for it. So David prepared abundantly before his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build an house for the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house unto the name of the L<span>ord</span> my God:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But the word of the L<span>ord</span> came to me, saying, Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son, and I <i>will</i> <i>be</i> his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Now, my son, the L<span>ord</span> be with thee; and prosper thou, and build the house of the L<span>ord</span> thy God, as he hath said of thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Only the L<span>ord</span> give thee wisdom and understanding, and give thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law of the L<span>ord</span> thy God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the statutes and judgments which the L<span>ord</span> charged Moses with concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not, nor be dismayed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the L<span>ord</span> an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Moreover <i>there</i> <i>are</i> workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for every manner of work.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no number. Arise <i>therefore</i>, and be doing, and the L<span>ord</span> be with thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon his son, <i>saying</i>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 <i>Is</i> not the L<span>ord</span> your God with you? and hath he <i>not</i> given you rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the L<span>ord</span>, and before his people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the L<span>ord</span> your God; arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the L<span>ord</span> God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span>, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his son king over Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Of which, twenty and four thousand <i>were</i> to set forward the work of the house of the L<span>ord</span>; and six thousand <i>were</i> officers and judges:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Moreover four thousand <i>were</i> porters; and four thousand praised the L<span>ord</span> with the instruments which I made, <i>said</i> <i>David</i>, to praise <i>therewith</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi, <i>namely</i>, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one reckoning, according to <i>their</i> father&rsquo;s house.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated, that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the L<span>ord</span>, to minister unto him, and to bless in his name for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Now <i>concerning</i> Moses the man of God, his sons were named of the tribe of Levi.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 For by the last words of David the Levites <i>were</i> numbered from twenty years old and above:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Because their office <i>was</i> to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the L<span>ord</span>, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest&rsquo;s office.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their offices in their service.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar; and <i>thus</i> were they divided.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the governors of the sanctuary, and governors <i>of</i> <i>the</i> <i>house</i> of God, were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, <i>one</i> of the Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and <i>before</i> the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites: one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and <i>one</i> taken for Ithamar.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And of all my sons, (for the L<span>ord</span> hath given me many sons,) he hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the kingdom of the L<span>ord</span> over Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the L<span>ord</span> searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Take heed now; for the L<span>ord</span> hath chosen thee to build an house for the sanctuary: be strong, and do <i>it</i>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 <i>He</i> <i>gave</i> of gold by weight for <i>things</i> of gold, for all instruments of all manner of service; <i>silver</i> <i>also</i> for all instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every kind of service:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for <i>things</i> <i>to</i> <i>be</i> <i>made</i> of gold, and the silver for <i>things</i> of silver, and the brass for <i>things</i> of brass, the iron for <i>things</i> of iron, and wood for <i>things</i> of wood; onyx stones, and <i>stones</i> to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, <i>which</i> I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 <i>Even</i> three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses <i>withal:</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king&rsquo;s work, offered willingly,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Thine, O L<span>ord</span>, <i>is</i> the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all <i>that</i> <i>is</i> in the heaven and in the earth <i>is</i> <i>thine;</i> thine <i>is</i> the kingdom, O L<span>ord</span>, and thou art exalted as head above all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Both riches and honour <i>come</i> of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand <i>is</i> power and might; and in thine hand <i>it</i> <i>is</i> to make great, and to give strength unto all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 But who <i>am</i> I, and what <i>is</i> my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things <i>come</i> of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 For we <i>are</i> strangers before thee, and sojourners, as <i>were</i> all our fathers: our days on the earth <i>are</i> as a shadow, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none abiding.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 O L<span>ord</span> our God, all this store that we have prepared to build thee an house for thine holy name <i>cometh</i> of thine hand, and <i>is</i> all thine own.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 O L<span>ord</span> God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all <i>these</i> <i>things</i>, and to build the palace, <i>for</i> the which I have made provision.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the L<span>ord</span> your God.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the L<span>ord</span>, and offered burnt offerings unto the L<span>ord</span>, on the morrow after that day, <i>even</i> a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, <i>and</i> a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And did eat and drink before the L<span>ord</span> on that day with great gladness.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the L<span>ord</span> as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And the L<span>ord</span> magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed upon him <i>such</i> royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 &para; Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And the time that he reigned over Israel <i>was</i> forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three <i>years</i> reigned he in Jerusalem.</span></p>
