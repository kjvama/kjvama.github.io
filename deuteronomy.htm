<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter1" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 These <i>be</i> the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red <i>sea</i>, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 (<i>There</i> <i>are</i> eleven days&rsquo; <i>journey</i> from Horeb by the way of mount Seir unto Kadesh-barnea.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Moses spake unto the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had given him in commandment unto them;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long enough in this mount:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the Amorites, and unto all <i>the</i> <i>places</i> nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the river Euphrates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye <i>are</i> this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye <i>are</i>, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken <i>is</i> good <i>for</i> <i>us</i> to do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear <i>the</i> <i>causes</i> between your brethren, and judge righteously between <i>every</i> man and his brother, and the stranger <i>that</i> <i>is</i> with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; <i>but</i> ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment <i>is</i> God&rsquo;s: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring <i>it</i> unto me, and I will hear it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 &para; And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up <i>and</i> possess <i>it</i>, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 &para; And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought <i>it</i> down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, <i>It</i> <i>is</i> a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, The people <i>is</i> greater and taller than we; the cities <i>are</i> great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went, until ye came into this place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch your tents <i>in</i>, in fire by night, to shew you by what way ye should go, and in a cloud by day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and sware, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 <i>But</i> Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 But <i>as</i> <i>for</i> you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>42 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither fight; for I <i>am</i> not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously up into the hill.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>44 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, <i>even</i> unto Hormah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>45 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>46 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode <i>there</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And command thou the people, saying, Ye <i>are</i> to pass through the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves therefore:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau <i>for</i> a possession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years the LORD thy God <i>hath</i> <i>been</i> with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land <i>for</i> a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot <i>for</i> a possession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Now rise up, <i>said</i> <i>I</i>, and get you over the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the space in which we came from Kadesh-barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, <i>was</i> thirty and eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from among the host, until they were consumed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And <i>when</i> thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon, distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon <i>any</i> possession; because I have given it unto the children of Lot <i>for</i> a possession.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, <i>even</i> unto Azzah, the Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 &para; Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon: behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess <i>it</i>, and contend with him in battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the nations <i>that</i> <i>are</i> under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 &para; And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as <i>appeareth</i> this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of the cities which we took.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 From Aroer, which <i>is</i> by the brink of the river of Arnon, and <i>from</i> the city that <i>is</i> by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered all unto us:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, <i>nor</i> unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was left to him remaining.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 All these cities <i>were</i> fenced with high walls, gates, and bars; beside unwalled towns a great many.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that <i>was</i> on this side Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And this land, <i>which</i> we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which <i>is</i> by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, <i>being</i> the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the border even unto the river Jabbok, <i>which</i> <i>is</i> the border of the children of Ammon;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast <i>thereof</i>, from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah eastward.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 &para; And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto me of this matter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <i>it</i> with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baal-peor: for all the men that followed Baal-peor, the LORD thy God hath destroyed them from among you.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on thy gates.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities, which thou buildedst not,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people which <i>are</i> round about you;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath commanded thee.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our eyes:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou shalt smite them, <i>and</i> utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled against you, and destroy thee suddenly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their altars, and break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For thou <i>art</i> an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself, above all people that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because ye were more in number than any people; for ye <i>were</i> the fewest of all people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he <i>is</i> God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto thy fathers:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them: neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that <i>will</i> <i>be</i> a snare unto thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations <i>are</i> more than I; how can I dispossess them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: <i>but</i> shalt well remember what the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm, whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be destroyed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be destroyed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest thou be a cursed thing like it: <i>but</i> thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it <i>is</i> a cursed thing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only, but by every <i>word</i> that proceedeth out of the mouth of the LORD doth man live.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom thou knowest, and <i>of</i> <i>whom</i> thou hast heard <i>say</i>, Who can stand before the children of Anak!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God <i>is</i> he which goeth over before thee; <i>as</i> a consuming fire he shall destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the LORD hath said unto thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth drive them out from before thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou <i>art</i> a stiffnecked people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; Remember, <i>and</i> forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, <i>even</i> the tables of the covenant which the LORD made with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them <i>was</i> <i>written</i> according to all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, <i>that</i> the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, <i>even</i> the tables of the covenant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted <i>themselves;</i> they are quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it <i>is</i> a stiffnecked people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned with fire: and the two tables of the covenant <i>were</i> in my two hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your God, <i>and</i> had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and brake them before your eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water, because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him: and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, <i>and</i> ground <i>it</i> very small, <i>even</i> until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye provoked the LORD to wrath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I knew you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights, as I fell down <i>at</i> <i>the</i> <i>first;</i> because the LORD had said he would destroy you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them out to slay them in the wilderness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Yet they <i>are</i> thy people and thine inheritance, which thou broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out arm.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter10" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 10</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount, and make thee an ark of wood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in the ark.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And I made an ark <i>of</i> shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in mine hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and the LORD gave them unto me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest&rsquo;s office in his stead.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that time also, <i>and</i> the LORD would not destroy thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take <i>thy</i> journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee, but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiffnecked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 For the LORD your God <i>is</i> God of gods, and Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not persons, nor taketh reward:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered <i>with</i> <i>fatness;</i> then he forsook God <i>which</i> made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 They provoked him to jealousy with strange <i>gods</i>, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new <i>gods</i> <i>that</i> came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Of the Rock <i>that</i> begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And when the LORD saw <i>it</i>, he abhorred <i>them</i>, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end <i>shall</i> <i>be:</i> for they <i>are</i> a very froward generation, children in whom <i>is</i> no faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 They have moved me to jealousy with <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>is</i> not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with <i>those</i> <i>which</i> <i>are</i> not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 <i>They</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling <i>also</i> with the man of gray hairs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, <i>and</i> lest they should say, Our hand <i>is</i> high, and the LORD hath not done all this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 For they <i>are</i> a nation void of counsel, neither <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> understanding in them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 O that they were wise, <i>that</i> they understood this, <i>that</i> they would consider their latter end!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 For their rock <i>is</i> not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves <i>being</i> judges.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 For their vine <i>is</i> of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes <i>are</i> grapes of gall, their clusters <i>are</i> bitter:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 Their wine <i>is</i> the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 <i>Is</i> not this laid up in store with me, <i>and</i> sealed up among my treasures?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 To me <i>belongeth</i> vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in <i>due</i> time: for the day of their calamity <i>is</i> at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that <i>their</i> power is gone, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none shut up, or left.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 And he shall say, Where <i>are</i> their gods, <i>their</i> rock in whom they trusted,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, <i>and</i> drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, <i>and</i> be your protection.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 See now that I, <i>even</i> I, <i>am</i> he, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither <i>is</i> <i>there</i> <i>any</i> that can deliver out of my hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>42 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; <i>and</i> <i>that</i> with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 Rejoice, O ye nations, <i>with</i> his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, <i>and</i> to his people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>44 &para; And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>45 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>46 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>47 For it <i>is</i> not a vain thing for you; because it <i>is</i> your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong <i>your</i> days in the land, whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>48 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>49 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, <i>unto</i> mount Nebo, which <i>is</i> in the land of Moab, that <i>is</i> over against Jericho; and behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>50 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>51 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>52 Yet thou shalt see the land before <i>thee;</i> but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints <i>are</i> in thy hand: and they sat down at thy feet; <i>every</i> <i>one</i> shall receive of thy words.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And of Levi he said, <i>Let</i> thy Thummim and thy Urim <i>be</i> with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, <i>and</i> <i>with</i> whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon thine altar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; <i>And</i> of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; <i>and</i> <i>the</i> <i>LORD</i> shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD <i>be</i> his land, for the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep that coucheth beneath,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 &para; And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and, Issachar, in thy tents.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck <i>of</i> the abundance of the seas, and <i>of</i> treasures hid in the sand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; And of Gad he said, Blessed <i>be</i> he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, <i>in</i> a portion of the lawgiver, <i>was</i> <i>he</i> seated; and he came with the heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and his judgments with Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 &para; And of Dan he said, Dan <i>is</i> a lion&rsquo;s whelp: he shall leap from Bashan.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that <i>is</i> over against Jericho. And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And the LORD said unto him, This <i>is</i> the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see <i>it</i> with thine eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; And Moses <i>was</i> an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping <i>and</i> mourning for Moses were ended.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</span></p>
