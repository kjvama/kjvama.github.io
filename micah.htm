<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter1" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THE word of the L<span>ord</span> that came to Micah the Morasthite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, <i>and</i> Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein is: and let the Lord G<span>od</span> be witness against you, the Lord from his holy temple.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For, behold, the L<span>ord</span> cometh forth out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, <i>and</i> as the waters <i>that</i> <i>are</i> poured down a steep place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 For the transgression of Jacob <i>is</i> all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel. What <i>is</i> the transgression of Jacob? <i>is</i> <i>it</i> not Samaria? and what <i>are</i> the high places of Judah? <i>are</i> <i>they</i> not Jerusalem?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, <i>and</i> as plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces, and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered <i>it</i> of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of an harlot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the owls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 For her wound <i>is</i> incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is come unto the gate of my people, <i>even</i> to Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; Declare ye <i>it</i> not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning of Beth-ezel; he shall receive of you his standing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but evil came down from the L<span>ord</span> unto the gate of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift beast: she <i>is</i> the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth-gath: the houses of Achzib <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> a lie to the kings of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah: he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into captivity from thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>WOE to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it is in the power of their hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And they covet fields, and take <i>them</i> by violence; and houses, and take <i>them</i> away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, against this family do I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks; neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time <i>is</i> evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; In that day shall <i>one</i> take up a parable against you, and lament with a doleful lamentation, <i>and</i> say, We be utterly spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he removed <i>it</i> from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Prophesy ye not, <i>say</i> <i>they</i> <i>to</i> <i>them</i> <i>that</i> prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, <i>that</i> they shall not take shame.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; O <i>thou</i> <i>that</i> <i>art</i> named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the L<span>ord</span> straitened? <i>are</i> these his doings? do not my words do good to him that walketh uprightly?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as men averse from war.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Arise ye, and depart; for this <i>is</i> not <i>your</i> rest: because it is polluted, it shall destroy <i>you</i>, even with a sore destruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, <i>saying</i>, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they shall make great noise by reason of <i>the</i> <i>multitude</i> <i>of</i> men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the L<span>ord</span> on the head of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; <i>Is</i> <i>it</i> not for you to know judgment?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Then shall they cry unto the L<span>ord</span>, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Therefore night <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no answer of God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the L<span>ord</span>, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the L<span>ord</span>, and say, <i>Is</i> not the L<span>ord</span> among us? none evil can come upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed <i>as</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter4" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>BUT in the last days it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the mountain of the house of the L<span>ord</span> shall be established in the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the L<span>ord</span>, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the L<span>ord</span> from Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make <i>them</i> afraid: for the mouth of the L<span>ord</span> of hosts hath spoken <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the L<span>ord</span> our God for ever and ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 In that day, saith the L<span>ord</span>, will I assemble her that halteth, and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have afflicted;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was cast far off a strong nation: and the L<span>ord</span> shall reign over them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? <i>is</i> <i>there</i> no king in thee? is thy counseller perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go <i>even</i> to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the L<span>ord</span> shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 But they know not the thoughts of the L<span>ord</span>, neither understand they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into the floor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain unto the L<span>ord</span>, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter5" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 5</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>NOW gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 But thou, Beth-lehem Ephratah, <i>though</i> thou be little among the thousands of Judah, <i>yet</i> out of thee shall he come forth unto me <i>that</i> <i>is</i> to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth <i>have</i> <i>been</i> from of old, from everlasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Therefore will he give them up, until the time <i>that</i> she which travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the L<span>ord</span>, in the majesty of the name of the L<span>ord</span> his God; and they shall abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And this <i>man</i> shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he deliver <i>us</i> from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land, and when he treadeth within our borders.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people as a dew from the L<span>ord</span>, as the showers upon the grass, that tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strong holds:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou shalt have no <i>more</i> soothsayers:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thy cities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter6" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 6</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>HEAR ye now what the L<span>ord</span> saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Hear ye, O mountains, the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the L<span>ord</span> hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? testify against me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; Wherewith shall I come before the L<span>ord</span>, <i>and</i> bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Will the L<span>ord</span> be pleased with thousands of rams, <i>or</i> with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn <i>for</i> my transgression, the fruit of my body <i>for</i> the sin of my soul?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 He hath shewed thee, O man, what <i>is</i> good; and what doth the L<span>ord</span> require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 The L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s voice crieth unto the city, and <i>the</i> <i>man</i> <i>of</i> wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure <i>that</i> <i>is</i> abominable?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Shall I count <i>them</i> pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue <i>is</i> deceitful in their mouth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Therefore also will I make <i>thee</i> sick in smiting thee, in making <i>thee</i> desolate because of thy sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and <i>that</i> which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter7" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 7</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>WOE is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 The good <i>man</i> is perished out of the earth: and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> none upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt every man his brother with a net.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince asketh, and the judge <i>asketh</i> for a reward; and the great <i>man</i>, he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 The best of them <i>is</i> as a brier: the most upright <i>is</i> <i>sharper</i> than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen <i>and</i> thy visitation cometh; now shall be their perplexity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law; a man&rsquo;s enemies <i>are</i> the men of his own house.</span></p>
