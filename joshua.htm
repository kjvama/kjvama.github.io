<p style="color: #000000; text-align: center;" data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter1" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>NOW after the death of Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> it came to pass, that the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses&rsquo; minister, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, <i>even</i> to the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life: as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with thee: I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto their fathers to give them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee: turn not from it <i>to</i> the right hand or <i>to</i> the left, that thou mayest prosper whithersoever thou goest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the L<span>ord</span> thy God <i>is</i> with thee whithersoever thou goest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the L<span>ord</span> your God giveth you to possess it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> commanded you, saying, The L<span>ord</span> your God hath given you rest, and hath given you this land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of valour, and help them;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Until the L<span>ord</span> have given your brethren rest, as <i>he</i> <i>hath</i> <i>given</i> you, and they also have possessed the land which the L<span>ord</span> your God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s servant gave you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee: only the L<span>ord</span> thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Whosoever <i>he</i> <i>be</i> that doth rebel against thy commandment, and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good courage.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went, and came into an harlot&rsquo;s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to search out the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine house: for they be come to search out all the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus, There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they <i>were:</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And it came to pass <i>about</i> <i>the</i> <i>time</i> of shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the roof;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And she said unto the men, I know that the L<span>ord</span> hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 For we have heard how the L<span>ord</span> dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites, that <i>were</i> on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And as soon as we had heard <i>these</i> <i>things</i>, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because of you: for the L<span>ord</span> your God, he <i>is</i> God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the L<span>ord</span>, since I have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto my father&rsquo;s house, and give me a true token:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And <i>that</i> ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver our lives from death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not this our business. And it shall be, when the L<span>ord</span> hath given us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house <i>was</i> upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And the men said unto her, We <i>will</i> <i>be</i> blameless of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Behold, <i>when</i> we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy brethren, and all thy father&rsquo;s household, home unto thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And it shall be, <i>that</i> whosoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> upon his head, and we <i>will</i> <i>be</i> guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> on our head, if <i>any</i> hand be upon him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And she said, According unto your words, so <i>be</i> it. And she sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet line in the window.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers sought <i>them</i> throughout all the way, but found <i>them</i> not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 &para; So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him all <i>things</i> that befell them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the L<span>ord</span> hath delivered into our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the country do faint because of us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the host;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed <i>this</i> way heretofore.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to morrow the L<span>ord</span> will do wonders among you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, <i>so</i> I will be with thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and hear the words of the L<span>ord</span> your God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God <i>is</i> among you, and <i>that</i> he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Jebusites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of every tribe a man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the L<span>ord</span>, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, <i>that</i> the waters of Jordan shall be cut off <i>from</i> the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon an heap.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 That the waters which came down from above stood <i>and</i> rose up upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that <i>is</i> beside Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, <i>even</i> the salt sea, failed, <i>and</i> were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter4" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 4</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over Jordan, that the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Joshua, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests&rsquo; feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you, and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the L<span>ord</span> your God into the midst of Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the number of the tribes of the children of Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 That this may be a sign among you, <i>that</i> when your children ask <i>their</i> <i>fathers</i> in time to come, saying, What <i>mean</i> ye by these stones?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span>; when it passed over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of Jordan, until every thing was finished that the L<span>ord</span> commanded Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of the L<span>ord</span> passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the L<span>ord</span> unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; On that day the L<span>ord</span> magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And the L<span>ord</span> spake unto Joshua, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> were come up out of the midst of Jordan, <i>and</i> the soles of the priests&rsquo; feet were lifted up unto the dry land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and flowed over all his banks, as <i>they</i> <i>did</i> before.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 &para; And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth <i>day</i> of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did Joshua pitch in Gilgal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What <i>mean</i> these stones?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 For the L<span>ord</span> your God dried up the waters of Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as the L<span>ord</span> your God did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were gone over:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the L<span>ord</span>, that it <i>is</i> mighty: that ye might fear the L<span>ord</span> your God for ever.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which <i>were</i> on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, which <i>were</i> by the sea, heard that the L<span>ord</span> had dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted, neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 &para; At that time the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And this <i>is</i> the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the people that came out of Egypt, <i>that</i> <i>were</i> males, <i>even</i> all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the people <i>that</i> <i>were</i> born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, <i>them</i> they had not circumcised.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the people <i>that</i> <i>were</i> men of war, which came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the voice of the L<span>ord</span>: unto whom the L<span>ord</span> sware that he would not shew them the land, which the L<span>ord</span> sware unto their fathers that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and honey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And their children, <i>whom</i> he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they had not circumcised them by the way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were whole.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the place is called Gilgal unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the plains of Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched <i>corn</i> in the selfsame day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua went unto him, and said unto him, <i>Art</i> thou for us, or for our adversaries?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And he said, Nay; but <i>as</i> captain of the host of the L<span>ord</span> am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did worship, and said unto him, What saith my lord unto his servant?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And the captain of the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s host said unto Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest <i>is</i> holy. And Joshua did so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter6" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 6</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>NOW Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of Israel: none went out, and none came in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand Jericho, and the king thereof, <i>and</i> the mighty men of valour.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And ye shall compass the city, all <i>ye</i> men of war, <i>and</i> go round about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long <i>blast</i> with the ram&rsquo;s horn, <i>and</i> when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall ascend up every man straight before him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the ark of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city, and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns passed on before the L<span>ord</span>, and blew with the trumpets: and the ark of the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> followed them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, <i>the</i> <i>priests</i> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall <i>any</i> word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then shall ye shout.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 So the ark of the L<span>ord</span> compassed the city, going about <i>it</i> once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the ark of the L<span>ord</span> went on continually, and blew with the trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward came after the ark of the L<span>ord</span>, <i>the</i> <i>priests</i> going on, and blowing with the trumpets.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned into the camp: so they did six days.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the L<span>ord</span> hath given you the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; And the city shall be accursed, <i>even</i> it, and all that <i>are</i> therein, to the L<span>ord</span>: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all that <i>are</i> with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And ye, in any wise keep <i>yourselves</i> from the accursed thing, lest ye make <i>yourselves</i> accursed, when ye take of the accursed thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, <i>are</i> consecrated unto the L<span>ord</span>: they shall come into the treasury of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 So the people shouted when <i>the</i> <i>priests</i> blew with the trumpets: and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And they utterly destroyed all that <i>was</i> in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the edge of the sword.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the country, Go into the harlot&rsquo;s house, and bring out thence the woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and left them without the camp of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that <i>was</i> therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father&rsquo;s household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel <i>even</i> unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 &para; And Joshua adjured <i>them</i> at that time, saying, Cursed <i>be</i> the man before the L<span>ord</span>, that riseth up and buildeth this city Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn, and in his youngest <i>son</i> shall he set up the gates of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 So the L<span>ord</span> was with Joshua; and his fame was <i>noised</i> throughout all the country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter7" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 7</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>BUT the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the L<span>ord</span> was kindled against the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which <i>is</i> beside Beth-aven, on the east side of Beth-el, and spake unto them, saying, Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; <i>and</i> make not all the people to labour thither; for they <i>are</i> <i>but</i> few.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand men: and they fled before the men of Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for they chased them <i>from</i> before the gate <i>even</i> unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the L<span>ord</span> until the eventide, he and the elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord G<span>od</span>, wherefore hast thou at all brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 O Lord, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs before their enemies!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear <i>of</i> <i>it</i>, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy face?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also, and they have put <i>it</i> even among their own stuff.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies, <i>but</i> turned <i>their</i> backs before their enemies, because they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the accursed from among you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow: for thus saith the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel, <i>There</i> <i>is</i> an accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed thing from among you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your tribes: and it shall be, <i>that</i> the tribe which the L<span>ord</span> taketh shall come according to the families <i>thereof;</i> and the family which the L<span>ord</span> shall take shall come by households; and the household which the L<span>ord</span> shall take shall come man by man.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And it shall be, <i>that</i> he that is taken with the accursed thing shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he hath transgressed the covenant of the L<span>ord</span>, and because he hath wrought folly in Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by man; and Zabdi was taken:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory to the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and tell me now what thou hast done; hide <i>it</i> not from me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned against the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they <i>are</i> hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 &para; So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, <i>it</i> <i>was</i> hid in his tent, and the silver under it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and laid them out before the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the L<span>ord</span> shall trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with stones.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day. So the L<span>ord</span> turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter8" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 8</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and his people, and his city, and his land:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour, and sent them away by night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, <i>even</i> behind the city: go not very far from the city, but be ye all ready:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And I, and all the people that <i>are</i> with me, will approach unto the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the first: therefore we will flee before them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the city: for the L<span>ord</span> your God will deliver it into your hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, <i>that</i> ye shall set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the L<span>ord</span> shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in ambush, and abode between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And all the people, <i>even</i> <i>the</i> <i>people</i> of war that <i>were</i> with him, went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched on the north side of Ai: now <i>there</i> <i>was</i> a valley between them and Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in ambush between Beth-el and Ai, on the west side of the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And when they had set the people, <i>even</i> all the host that <i>was</i> on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw <i>it</i>, that they hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that <i>there</i> <i>were</i> liers in ambush against him behind the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And all the people that <i>were</i> in Ai were called together to pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were drawn away from the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And there was not a man left in Ai or Beth-el, that went not out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that <i>is</i> in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And Joshua stretched out the spear that <i>he</i> <i>had</i> in his hand toward the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again, and slew the men of Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them remain or escape.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And <i>so</i> it was, <i>that</i> all that fell that day, both of men and women, <i>were</i> twelve thousand, <i>even</i> all the men of Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the L<span>ord</span> which he commanded Joshua.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, <i>even</i> a desolation unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great heap of stones, <i>that</i> <i>remaineth</i> unto this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 &para; Then Joshua built an altar unto the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel in mount Ebal,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 As Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> commanded the children of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up <i>any</i> iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the L<span>ord</span>, and sacrificed peace offerings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 &para; And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were conversant among them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND it came to pass, when all the kings which <i>were</i> on this side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard <i>thereof;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua and with Israel, with one accord.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry <i>and</i> mouldy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And they said unto Joshua, We <i>are</i> thy servants. And Joshua said unto them, Who <i>are</i> ye? and from whence come ye?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the L<span>ord</span> thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that <i>were</i> beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which <i>was</i> at Ashtaroth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We <i>are</i> your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 This our bread we took hot <i>for</i> our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, <i>were</i> new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not <i>counsel</i> at the mouth of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they <i>were</i> their neighbours, and <i>that</i> they dwelt among them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities <i>were</i> Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjath-jearim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel: now therefore we may not touch them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 &para; And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We <i>are</i> very far from you; when ye dwell among us?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Now therefore ye <i>are</i> cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the L<span>ord</span> thy God commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And now, behold, we <i>are</i> in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of Israel, that they slew them not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the L<span>ord</span>, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter10" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 10</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>NOW it came to pass, when Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem had heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel, and were among them;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon <i>was</i> a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it <i>was</i> greater than Ai, and all the men thereof <i>were</i> mighty.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Wherefore Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent unto Hoham king of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before Gibeon, and made war against it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valour.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them stand before thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, <i>and</i> went up from Gilgal all night.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And the L<span>ord</span> discomfited them before Israel, and slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goeth up to Beth-horon, and smote them to Azekah, and unto Makkedah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, <i>and</i> were in the going down to Beth-horon, that the L<span>ord</span> cast down great stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: <i>they</i> <i>were</i> more which died with hailstones than <i>they</i> whom the children of Israel slew with the sword.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Then spake Joshua to the L<span>ord</span> in the day when the L<span>ord</span> delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. <i>Is</i> not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the L<span>ord</span> hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the L<span>ord</span> fought for Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid in a cave at Makkedah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave, and set men by it for to keep them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And stay ye not, <i>but</i> pursue after your enemies, and smite the hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities: for the L<span>ord</span> your God hath delivered them into your hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter, till they were consumed, that the rest <i>which</i> remained of them entered into fenced cities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, <i>and</i> the king of Eglon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage: for thus shall the L<span>ord</span> do to all your enemies against whom ye fight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until the evening.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun, <i>that</i> Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees, and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and laid great stones in the cave&rsquo;s mouth, <i>which</i> <i>remain</i> until this very day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 &para; And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that <i>were</i> therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And the L<span>ord</span> delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that <i>were</i> therein; he let none remain in it; but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of Jericho.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 &para; And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And the L<span>ord</span> delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that <i>were</i> therein, according to all that he had done to Libnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 &para; Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua smote him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 &para; And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that <i>were</i> therein he utterly destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the souls that <i>were</i> therein; he left none remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and all the souls that <i>were</i> therein.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 &para; And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and fought against it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed all the souls that <i>were</i> therein; he left none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to her king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 &para; So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel commanded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 And Joshua smote them from Kadesh-barnea even unto Gaza, and all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>42 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time, because the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel fought for Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter11" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 11</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard <i>those</i> <i>things</i>, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And to the kings that <i>were</i> on the north of the mountains, and of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in the borders of Dor on the west,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 <i>And</i> <i>to</i> the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and <i>to</i> the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the mountains, and <i>to</i> the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much people, even as the sand that <i>is</i> upon the sea shore in multitude, with horses and chariots very many.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And when all these kings were met together, they came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them: for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And the L<span>ord</span> delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto Misrephoth-maim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they smote them, until they left them none remaining.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And Joshua did unto them as the L<span>ord</span> bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And they smote all the souls that <i>were</i> therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying <i>them:</i> there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them, did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, <i>and</i> he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> commanded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 But <i>as</i> <i>for</i> the cities that stood still in their strength, Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; <i>that</i> did Joshua burn.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; As the L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that the L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 <i>Even</i> from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 There was not a city that made peace with the children of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all <i>other</i> they took in battle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 For it was of the L<span>ord</span> to harden their hearts, that they should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy them utterly, <i>and</i> that they might have no favour, but that he might destroy them, as the L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 &para; And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the L<span>ord</span> said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the land rested from war.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 From Sihor, which <i>is</i> before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, <i>which</i> is counted to the Canaanite: five lords of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the Avites:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah that <i>is</i> beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto Misrephoth-maim, <i>and</i> all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward, <i>even</i> as Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> gave them;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave none inheritance among them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the land, save cities to dwell <i>in</i>, with their suburbs for their cattle and for their substance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 As the L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did, and they divided the land.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Forty years old <i>was</i> I when Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> sent me from Kadesh-barnea to espy out the land; and I brought him word again as <i>it</i> <i>was</i> in mine heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt: but I wholly followed the L<span>ord</span> my God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy children&rsquo;s for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the L<span>ord</span> my God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And now, behold, the L<span>ord</span> hath kept me alive, as he said, these forty and five years, even since the L<span>ord</span> spake this word unto Moses, while <i>the</i> <i>children</i> <i>of</i> Israel wandered in the wilderness: and now, lo, I <i>am</i> this day fourscore and five years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 As yet I <i>am</i> <i>as</i> strong this day as <i>I</i> <i>was</i> in the day that Moses sent me: as my strength <i>was</i> then, even so <i>is</i> my strength now, for war, both to go out, and to come in.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the L<span>ord</span> spake in that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims <i>were</i> there, and <i>that</i> the cities <i>were</i> great <i>and</i> fenced: if so be the L<span>ord</span> <i>will</i> <i>be</i> with me, then I shall be able to drive them out, as the L<span>ord</span> said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly followed the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their families was <i>thus:</i> even the border of their inheritance on the east side was Ataroth-addar, unto Beth-horon the upper;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the north side; and the border went about eastward unto Taanath-shiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This <i>is</i> the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim <i>were</i> among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and serve under tribute.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THERE was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he <i>was</i> the firstborn of Joseph; <i>to</i> <i>wit</i>, for Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war, therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 There was also <i>a</i> <i>lot</i> for the rest of the children of Manasseh by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for the children of Shemida: these <i>were</i> the male children of Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters: and these <i>are</i> the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The L<span>ord</span> commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brethren.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of Gilead and Bashan, which <i>were</i> on the other side Jordan;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons: and the rest of Manasseh&rsquo;s sons had the land of Gilead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that <i>lieth</i> before Shechem; and the border went along on the right hand unto the inhabitants of En-tappuah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 <i>Now</i> Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the border of Manasseh <i>belonged</i> to the children of Ephraim;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Southward <i>it</i> <i>was</i> Ephraim&rsquo;s, and northward <i>it</i> <i>was</i> Manasseh&rsquo;s, and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on the north, and in Issachar on the east.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth-shean and her towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, <i>even</i> three countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out <i>the</i> <i>inhabitants</i> <i>of</i> those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me <i>but</i> one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I <i>am</i> a great people, forasmuch as the L<span>ord</span> hath blessed me hitherto?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And Joshua answered them, If thou <i>be</i> a great people, <i>then</i> get thee up to the wood <i>country</i>, and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim be too narrow for thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, <i>both</i> <i>they</i> who <i>are</i> of Beth-shean and her towns, and <i>they</i> who <i>are</i> of the valley of Jezreel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which Moses the servant of the L<span>ord</span> charged you, to love the L<span>ord</span> your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel out of Shiloh, which <i>is</i> in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the L<span>ord</span> by the hand of Moses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that <i>are</i> in the land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to see to.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 <i>Is</i> the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the L<span>ord</span>,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 &para; Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 The L<span>ord</span> God of gods, the L<span>ord</span> God of gods, he knoweth, and Israel he shall know; if <i>it</i> <i>be</i> in rebellion, or if in transgression against the L<span>ord</span>, (save us not this day,)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the L<span>ord</span>, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the L<span>ord</span> himself require <i>it;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And if we have not <i>rather</i> done it for fear of <i>this</i> thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 For the L<span>ord</span> hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the L<span>ord</span>: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should <i>so</i> say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say <i>again</i>, Behold the pattern of the altar of the L<span>ord</span>, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it <i>is</i> a witness between us and you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 God forbid that we should rebel against the L<span>ord</span>, and turn this day from following the L<span>ord</span>, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the L<span>ord</span> our God that <i>is</i> before his tabernacle.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 &para; And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which <i>were</i> with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the L<span>ord</span>: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of Reuben and Gad dwelt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar <i>Ed:</i> for it <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> a witness between us that the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> God.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But cleave unto the L<span>ord</span> your God, as ye have done unto this day.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; Now therefore fear the L<span>ord</span>, and serve him in sincerity and in truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the L<span>ord</span>, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that <i>were</i> on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should forsake the L<span>ord</span>, to serve other gods;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 For the L<span>ord</span> our God, he <i>it</i> <i>is</i> that brought us up and our fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people through whom we passed:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And the L<span>ord</span> drave out from before us all the people, even the Amorites which dwelt in the land: <i>therefore</i> will we also serve the L<span>ord</span>; for he <i>is</i> our God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the L<span>ord</span>: for he <i>is</i> an holy God; he <i>is</i> a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 If ye forsake the L<span>ord</span>, and serve strange gods, then he will turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done you good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye <i>are</i> witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen you the L<span>ord</span>, to serve him. And they said, <i>We</i> <i>are</i> witnesses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Now therefore put away, <i>said</i> <i>he</i>, the strange gods which <i>are</i> among you, and incline your heart unto the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And the people said unto Joshua, The L<span>ord</span> our God will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 &para; And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that <i>was</i> by the sanctuary of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the L<span>ord</span> which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness unto you, lest ye deny your God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his inheritance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 &para; And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L<span>ord</span>, died, <i>being</i> an hundred and ten years old.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which <i>is</i> in mount Ephraim, on the north side of the hill of Gaash.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And Israel served the L<span>ord</span> all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known all the works of the L<span>ord</span>, that he had done for Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 &para; And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill <i>that</i> <i>pertained</i> <i>to</i> Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.</span> </p>
