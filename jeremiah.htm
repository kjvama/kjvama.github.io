            <p style="color: #000000; text-align: center;" data-ke-size="size16">&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter1" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THE words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that <i>were</i> in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 To whom the word of the L<span>ord</span> came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Then the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, <i>and</i> I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then said I, Ah, Lord G<span>od</span>! behold, I cannot speak: for I <i>am</i> a child.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; But the L<span>ord</span> said unto me, Say not, I <i>am</i> a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt speak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Be not afraid of their faces: for I <i>am</i> with thee to deliver thee, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Then the L<span>ord</span> put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the L<span>ord</span> said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Moreover the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Then said the L<span>ord</span> unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof <i>is</i> toward the north.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Then the L<span>ord</span> said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the L<span>ord</span>; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and against the people of the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I <i>am</i> with thee, saith the L<span>ord</span>, to deliver thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>MOREOVER the word of the L<span>ord</span> came to me, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land <i>that</i> <i>was</i> not sown.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Israel <i>was</i> holiness unto the L<span>ord</span>, <i>and</i> the firstfruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Hear ye the word of the L<span>ord</span>, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Neither said they, Where <i>is</i> the L<span>ord</span> that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made mine heritage an abomination.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 The priests said not, Where <i>is</i> the L<span>ord</span>? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after <i>things</i> <i>that</i> do not profit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the L<span>ord</span>, and with your children&rsquo;s children will I plead.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Hath a nation changed <i>their</i> gods, which <i>are</i> yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for <i>that</i> <i>which</i> doth not profit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, <i>and</i> hewed them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; <i>Is</i> Israel a servant? <i>is</i> he a homeborn <i>slave?</i> why is he spoiled?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 The young lions roared upon him, <i>and</i> yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast forsaken the L<span>ord</span> thy God, when he led thee by the way?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that <i>it</i> <i>is</i> an evil <i>thing</i> and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the L<span>ord</span> thy God, and that my fear <i>is</i> not in thee, saith the Lord G<span>od</span> of hosts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; For of old time I have broken thy yoke, <i>and</i> burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, <i>yet</i> thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord G<span>od</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: <i>thou</i> <i>art</i> a swift dromedary traversing her ways;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 A wild ass used to the wilderness, <i>that</i> snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Saying to a stock, Thou <i>art</i> my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned <i>their</i> back unto me, and not <i>their</i> face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 But where <i>are</i> thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 &para; O generation, see ye the word of the L<span>ord</span>. Have I been a wilderness unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords; we will come no more unto thee?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Can a maid forget her ornaments, <i>or</i> a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head: for the L<span>ord</span> hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THEY say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man&rsquo;s, shall he return unto her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no latter rain; and thou hadst a whore&rsquo;s forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou <i>art</i> the guide of my youth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Will he reserve <i>his</i> <i>anger</i> for ever? will he keep <i>it</i> to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; The L<span>ord</span> said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen <i>that</i> which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And I said after she had done all these <i>things</i>, Turn thou unto me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the L<span>ord</span>, and I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Therefore will I do unto <i>this</i> house, which is called by my name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead <i>their</i> dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to anger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Do they provoke me to anger? saith the L<span>ord</span>: <i>do</i> <i>they</i> not <i>provoke</i> themselves to the confusion of their own faces?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Therefore thus saith the Lord G<span>od</span>; Behold, mine anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 &para; Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels <i>and</i> in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets, daily rising up early and sending <i>them:</i></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 But thou shalt say unto them, This <i>is</i> a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the L<span>ord</span> their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 &para; Cut off thine hair, <i>O</i> <i>Jerusalem</i>, and cast <i>it</i> away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the L<span>ord</span> hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the L<span>ord</span>: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, which <i>is</i> in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded <i>them</i> not, neither came it into my heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 &para; Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray <i>them</i> away.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Their tongue <i>is</i> <i>as</i> an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: <i>one</i> speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And I will make Jerusalem heaps, <i>and</i> a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day <i>that</i> I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, <i>even</i> unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded <i>them</i> to do; but they did <i>them</i> not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And the L<span>ord</span> said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 They are turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, which refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Behold, I will bring evil upon them, which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry unto me, I will not hearken unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 For <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and <i>according</i> <i>to</i> the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to <i>that</i> shameful thing, <i>even</i> altars to burn incense unto Baal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear <i>them</i> in the time that they cry unto me for their trouble.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 What hath my beloved to do in mine house, <i>seeing</i> she hath wrought lewdness with many, and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 The L<span>ord</span> called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, <i>and</i> of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 For the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense unto Baal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 &para; And the L<span>ord</span> hath given me knowledge <i>of</i> <i>it</i>, and I know <i>it:</i> then thou shewedst me their doings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 But I <i>was</i> like a lamb <i>or</i> an ox <i>that</i> is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, <i>saying</i>, Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 But, O L<span>ord</span> of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of the men of Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name of the L<span>ord</span>, that thou die not by our hand:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> against all mine evil neighbours, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And it shall come to pass, after that I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me the second time, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Take the girdle that thou hast got, which <i>is</i> upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the L<span>ord</span> commanded me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And it came to pass after many days, that the L<span>ord</span> said unto me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and, behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Then the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 This evil people, which refuse to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the L<span>ord</span>; that they might be unto me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word; Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say unto thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David&rsquo;s throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the L<span>ord</span>: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, <i>and</i> found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bare them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; <i>but</i> they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcases shall be meat for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the L<span>ord</span>, <i>even</i> lovingkindness and mercies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall <i>men</i> lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Neither shall <i>men</i> tear <i>themselves</i> for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall <i>men</i> give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Thou shalt not also go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt shew this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee, Wherefore hath the L<span>ord</span> pronounced all this great evil against us? or what <i>is</i> our iniquity? or what <i>is</i> our sin that we have committed against the L<span>ord</span> our God?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the L<span>ord</span>, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, <i>neither</i> ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that it shall no more be said, The L<span>ord</span> liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 But, The L<span>ord</span> liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the L<span>ord</span>, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 For mine eyes <i>are</i> upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 O L<span>ord</span>, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and <i>things</i> wherein <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no profit.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they <i>are</i> no gods?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name <i>is</i> The L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 &para; Thus said the L<span>ord</span> unto me; Go and stand in the gate of the children of the people, whereby the kings of Judah come in, and by the which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And say unto them, Hear ye the word of the L<span>ord</span>, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring <i>it</i> in by the gates of Jerusalem;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the L<span>ord</span>, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and meat offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, unto the house of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 But if ye will not hearken unto me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering in at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THE word which came to Jeremiah from the L<span>ord</span>, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Arise, and go down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Then I went down to the potter&rsquo;s house, and, behold, he wrought a work on the wheels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Then the word of the L<span>ord</span> came to me, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the L<span>ord</span>. Behold, as the clay <i>is</i> in the potter&rsquo;s hand, so <i>are</i> ye in mine hand, O house of Israel.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 <i>At</i> <i>what</i> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy <i>it;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 If that nation, against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And <i>at</i> <i>what</i> instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant <i>it;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 If it do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Now therefore go to, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways <i>from</i> the ancient paths, to walk in paths, <i>in</i> a way not cast up;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 &para; Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Give heed to me, O L<span>ord</span>, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, <i>and</i> to turn away thy wrath from them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Therefore deliver up their children to the famine, and pour out their <i>blood</i> by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and <i>be</i> widows; and let their men be put to death; <i>let</i> their young men <i>be</i> slain by the sword in battle.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire <i>for</i> burnt offerings unto Baal, which I commanded not, nor spake <i>it</i>, neither came <i>it</i> into my mind:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcases will I give to be meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And I will make this city desolate, and an hissing; every one that passeth thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all the plagues thereof.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall straiten them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all the labours thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; O L<span>ord</span>, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 For since I spake, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the L<span>ord</span> was made a reproach unto me, and a derision, daily.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But <i>his</i> <i>word</i> was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not <i>stay</i>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 But the L<span>ord</span> <i>is</i> with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: <i>their</i> everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 But, O L<span>ord</span> of hosts, that triest the righteous, <i>and</i> seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Sing unto the L<span>ord</span>, praise ye the L<span>ord</span>: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Inquire, I pray thee, of the L<span>ord</span> for us; for Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; if so be that the L<span>ord</span> will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 &para; Then said Jeremiah unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that <i>are</i> in your hands, wherewith ye fight against the king of Babylon, and <i>against</i> the Chaldeans, which besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And afterward, saith the L<span>ord</span>, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be unto him for a prey.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the L<span>ord</span>: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; And touching the house of the king of Judah, <i>say</i>, Hear ye the word of the L<span>ord</span>;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 O house of David, thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver <i>him</i> <i>that</i> <i>is</i> spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench <i>it</i>, because of the evil of your doings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Behold, I <i>am</i> against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, <i>and</i> rock of the plain, saith the L<span>ord</span>; which say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the L<span>ord</span>: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter22" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 22</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THUS saith the L<span>ord</span>; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And say, Hear the word of the L<span>ord</span>, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter in by these gates:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that this house shall become a desolation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> unto the king&rsquo;s house of Judah; Thou <i>art</i> Gilead unto me, <i>and</i> the head of Lebanon: <i>yet</i> surely I will make thee a wilderness, <i>and</i> cities <i>which</i> are not inhabited.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast <i>them</i> into the fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath the L<span>ord</span> done thus unto this great city?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the L<span>ord</span> their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: <i>but</i> weep sore for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 &para; Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; <i>that</i> useth his neighbour&rsquo;s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and <i>it</i> <i>is</i> cieled with cedar, and painted with vermilion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Shalt thou reign, because thou closest <i>thyself</i> in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, <i>and</i> then <i>it</i> <i>was</i> well with him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then <i>it</i> <i>was</i> well <i>with</i> <i>him:</i> <i>was</i> not this to know me? saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 But thine eyes and thine heart <i>are</i> not but for thy covetousness, and for to shed innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span> concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, <i>saying</i>, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, <i>saying</i>, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 I spake unto thee in thy prosperity; <i>but</i> thou saidst, I will not hear. This <i>hath</i> <i>been</i> thy manner from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 <i>As</i> I live, saith the L<span>ord</span>, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand <i>of</i> <i>them</i> whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 <i>Is</i> this man Coniah a despised broken idol? <i>is</i> <i>he</i> a vessel wherein <i>is</i> no pleasure? wherefore are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Write ye this man childless, a man <i>that</i> shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter23" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 23</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>WOE be unto the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Behold, the days come, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this <i>is</i> his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that they shall no more say, The L<span>ord</span> liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But, The L<span>ord</span> liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I had driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; Mine heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the L<span>ord</span>, and because of the words of his holiness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force <i>is</i> not right.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 For both prophet and priest are profane; yea, in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Wherefore their way shall be unto them as slippery <i>ways</i> in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, <i>even</i> the year of their visitation, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them unto me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, Hearken not unto the words of the prophets that prophesy unto you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, <i>and</i> not out of the mouth of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 They say still unto them that despise me, The L<span>ord</span> hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 For who hath stood in the counsel of the L<span>ord</span>, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard <i>it?</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Behold, a whirlwind of the L<span>ord</span> is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 The anger of the L<span>ord</span> shall not return, until he have executed, and till he have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they should have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 <i>Am</i> I a God at hand, saith the L<span>ord</span>, and not a God afar off?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the L<span>ord</span>. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 How long shall <i>this</i> be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yea, <i>they</i> <i>are</i> prophets of the deceit of their own heart;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Which think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What <i>is</i> the chaff to the wheat? saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 <i>Is</i> not my word like as a fire? saith the L<span>ord</span>; and like a hammer <i>that</i> breaketh the rock in pieces?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Therefore, behold, I <i>am</i> against the prophets, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 Behold, I <i>am</i> against the prophets, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that use their tongues, and say, He saith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Behold, I <i>am</i> against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the L<span>ord</span>, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 &para; And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What <i>is</i> the burden of the L<span>ord</span>? thou shalt then say unto them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And <i>as</i> <i>for</i> the prophet, and the priest, and the people, that shall say, The burden of the L<span>ord</span>, I will even punish that man and his house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to his brother, What hath the L<span>ord</span> answered? and, What hath the L<span>ord</span> spoken?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 And the burden of the L<span>ord</span> shall ye mention no more: for every man&rsquo;s word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the L<span>ord</span> of hosts our God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the L<span>ord</span> answered thee? and, What hath the L<span>ord</span> spoken?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 But since ye say, The burden of the L<span>ord</span>; therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Because ye say this word, The burden of the L<span>ord</span>, and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the L<span>ord</span>;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 Therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave you and your fathers, <i>and</i> <i>cast</i> <i>you</i> out of my presence:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THE L<span>ord</span> shewed me, and, behold, two baskets of figs <i>were</i> set before the temple of the L<span>ord</span>, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 One basket <i>had</i> very good figs, <i>even</i> like the figs <i>that</i> <i>are</i> first ripe: and the other basket <i>had</i> very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Then said the L<span>ord</span> unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the evil, very evil, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; Again the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull <i>them</i> down; and I will plant them, and not pluck <i>them</i> up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And I will give them an heart to know me, that I <i>am</i> the L<span>ord</span>: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil; surely thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, <i>even</i> all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of them also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> God of Israel unto me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 And they shall drink, and be moved, and be mad, because of the sword that I will send among them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Then took I the cup at the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s hand, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom the L<span>ord</span> had sent me:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and spue, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thine hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 For, lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished?

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say unto them, The L<span>ord</span> shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread <i>the</i> <i>grapes</i>, against all the inhabitants of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 A noise shall come <i>even</i> to the ends of the earth; for the L<span>ord</span> hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them <i>that</i> <i>are</i> wicked to the sword, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 &para; Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>ashes</i>, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and an howling of the principal of the flock, <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> <i>heard:</i> for the L<span>ord</span> hath spoiled their pasture.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>IN the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the L<span>ord</span>, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Stand in the court of the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s house, and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship in the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s house, all the words that I command thee to speak unto them; diminish not a word:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 If so be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent me of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my law, which I have set before you,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 So the priests and the prophets and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the L<span>ord</span> had commanded <i>him</i> to speak unto all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the L<span>ord</span>, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah in the house of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king&rsquo;s house unto the house of the L<span>ord</span>, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s <i>house</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Then spake the priests and the prophets unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man <i>is</i> worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Then spake Jeremiah unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The L<span>ord</span> sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the L<span>ord</span> your God; and the L<span>ord</span> will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 As for me, behold, I <i>am</i> in your hand: do with me as seemeth good and meet unto you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and upon the inhabitants thereof: for of a truth the L<span>ord</span> hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; Then said the princes and all the people unto the priests and to the prophets; This man <i>is</i> not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the L<span>ord</span> our God.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Then rose up certain of the elders of the land, and spake to all the assembly of the people, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spake to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts; Zion shall be plowed <i>like</i> a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of a forest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the L<span>ord</span>, and besought the L<span>ord</span>, and the L<span>ord</span> repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the L<span>ord</span>, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, <i>namely</i>, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and <i>certain</i> men with him into Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter27" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 27</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>IN the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the L<span>ord</span>, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> to me; Make thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyrus, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And command them to say unto their masters, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say unto your masters;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 I have made the earth, the man and the beast that <i>are</i> upon the ground, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet unto me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son&rsquo;s son, until the very time of his land come: and then many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the L<span>ord</span>, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Therefore hearken not ye to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the L<span>ord</span>; and they shall till it, and dwell therein.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; I spake also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the L<span>ord</span> hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Therefore hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 For I have not sent them, saith the L<span>ord</span>, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy unto you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Also I spake to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the L<span>ord</span>&rsquo;s house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie unto you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: wherefore should this city be laid waste?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 But if they <i>be</i> prophets, and if the word of the L<span>ord</span> be with them, let them now make intercession to the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the L<span>ord</span>, and <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 &para; For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Yea, thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain <i>in</i> the house of the L<span>ord</span>, and <i>in</i> the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the L<span>ord</span>; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter28" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 28</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, <i>and</i> in the fifth month, <i>that</i> Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which <i>was</i> of Gibeon, spake unto me in the house of the L<span>ord</span>, in the presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Thus speaketh the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the L<span>ord</span>,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears, and in the ears of all the people;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 The prophet which prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, <i>then</i> shall the prophet be known, that the L<span>ord</span> hath truly sent him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah&rsquo;s neck, and brake it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 And Hananiah spake in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years.

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The L<span>ord</span> hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 <i>Know</i> that thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and of all the people that dwelleth in this city, <i>and</i> of your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so evil.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; Hear ye therefore the word of the L<span>ord</span>, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Because they have committed villany in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours&rsquo; wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and <i>am</i> a witness, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 &para; <i>Thus</i> shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 The L<span>ord</span> hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the L<span>ord</span>, for every man <i>that</i> <i>is</i> mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, which maketh himself a prophet to you?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the L<span>ord</span>; because he hath taught rebellion against the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For, lo, the days come, saith the L<span>ord</span>, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the L<span>ord</span>: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And these <i>are</i> the words that the L<span>ord</span> spake concerning Israel and concerning Judah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Alas! for that day <i>is</i> great, so that none <i>is</i> like it: it <i>is</i> even the time of Jacob&rsquo;s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, <i>that</i> I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more serve themselves of him:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 But they shall serve the L<span>ord</span> their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 &para; Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the L<span>ord</span>; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for, lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and be quiet, and none shall make <i>him</i> afraid.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 For then the king of Babylon&rsquo;s army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the prison, which <i>was</i> in the king of Judah&rsquo;s house.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Wherefore dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the L<span>ord</span>: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; And Jeremiah said, The word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto me, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 So Hanameel mine uncle&rsquo;s son came to me in the court of the prison according to the word of the L<span>ord</span>, and said unto me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that <i>is</i> in Anathoth, which <i>is</i> in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance <i>is</i> thine, and the redemption <i>is</i> thine; buy <i>it</i> for thyself. Then I knew that this <i>was</i> the word of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle&rsquo;s son, that <i>was</i> in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, <i>even</i> seventeen shekels of silver.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And I subscribed the evidence, and sealed <i>it</i>, and took witnesses, and weighed <i>him</i> the money in the balances.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 So I took the evidence of the purchase, <i>both</i> that which was sealed <i>according</i> to the law and custom, and that which was open:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the L<span>ord</span>, saying,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with great terror;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Behold the mounts, they are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou seest <i>it</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 And thou hast said unto me, O Lord G<span>od</span>, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 &para; Then came the word of the L<span>ord</span> unto Jeremiah, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Behold, I <i>am</i> the L<span>ord</span>, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have only done evil before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 For this city hath been to me <i>as</i> a provocation of mine anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising up early and teaching <i>them</i>, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>35 And they built the high places of Baal, which <i>are</i> in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through <i>the</i> <i>fire</i> unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>36 &para; And now therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, the God of Israel, concerning this city, whereof ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>37 Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in mine anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>38 And they shall be my people, and I will be their God:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>39 And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>41 Yea, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>42 For thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Like as I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>43 And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say, <i>It</i> <i>is</i> desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Yet hear the word of the L<span>ord</span>, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spake all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 When the king of Babylon&rsquo;s army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these defenced cities remained of the cities of Judah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Now when all the princes, and all the people, which had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should let his manservant, and every one his maidservant, go free, that none should serve themselves of them any more, then they obeyed, and let <i>them</i> go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 But afterward they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Therefore the word of the L<span>ord</span> came to Jeremiah from the L<span>ord</span>, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondmen, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 At the end of seven years let ye go every man his brother an Hebrew, which hath been sold unto thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined their ear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And ye were now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 But ye turned and polluted my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for servants and for handmaids.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the L<span>ord</span>, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, which have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in twain, and passed between the parts thereof,</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink ye wine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, <i>neither</i> ye, nor your sons for ever:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have <i>any:</i> but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye <i>be</i> strangers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Then he went down into the king&rsquo;s house, into the scribe&rsquo;s chamber: and, lo, all the princes sat there, <i>even</i> Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came unto them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read <i>it</i> in their ears.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Now it came to pass, when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and other, and said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote <i>them</i> with ink in the book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Then said the princes unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 &para; And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe&rsquo;s chamber. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month: and <i>there</i> <i>was</i> <i>a</i> <i>fire</i> on the hearth burning before him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast <i>it</i> into the fire that <i>was</i> on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that <i>was</i> on the hearth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, <i>neither</i> the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the L<span>ord</span> hid them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 &para; Then the word of the L<span>ord</span> came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah hath burned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 Therefore thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 &para; Then took Jeremiah another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were added besides unto them many like words.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter37" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 37</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>AND king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, did hearken unto the words of the L<span>ord</span>, which he spake by the prophet Jeremiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the L<span>ord</span> our God for us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Then Pharaoh&rsquo;s army was come forth out of Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 &para; Then came the word of the L<span>ord</span> unto the prophet Jeremiah, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh&rsquo;s army, which is come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans shall surely depart from us: for they shall not depart.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained <i>but</i> wounded men among them, <i>yet</i> should they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh&rsquo;s army,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward <i>was</i> there, whose name <i>was</i> Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Then said Jeremiah, <i>It</i> <i>is</i> false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 &para; When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there <i>any</i> word from the L<span>ord</span>? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Where <i>are</i> now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers&rsquo; street, until all the bread in the city were spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter38" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 38</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THEN Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon&rsquo;s army, which shall take it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he <i>is</i> in your hand: for the king <i>is</i> not <i>he</i> <i>that</i> can do <i>any</i> thing against you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then took they Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that <i>was</i> in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon <i>there</i> <i>was</i> no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; Now when Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king&rsquo;s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Ebed-melech went forth out of the king&rsquo;s house, and spake to the king, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is: for <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no more bread in the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old rotten rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now <i>these</i> old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him up out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 &para; Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that <i>is</i> in the house of the L<span>ord</span>: and the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare <i>it</i> unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken unto me?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 So Zedekiah the king sware secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, <i>As</i> the L<span>ord</span> liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span>, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth unto the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thine house:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver <i>thee</i>. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the L<span>ord</span>, which I speak unto thee: so it shall be well unto thee, and thy soul shall live.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 But if thou refuse to go forth, this <i>is</i> the word that the L<span>ord</span> hath shewed me:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah&rsquo;s house <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> brought forth to the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes, and those <i>women</i> shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, <i>and</i> they are turned away back.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 &para; Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 Then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan&rsquo;s house, to die there.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 Then came all the princes unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was <i>there</i> when Jerusalem was taken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter39" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 39</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>IN the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 <i>And</i> in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth <i>day</i> of the month, the city was broken up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, <i>even</i> Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And it came to pass, <i>that</i> when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king&rsquo;s garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 But the Chaldeans&rsquo; army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Moreover he put out Zedekiah&rsquo;s eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; And the Chaldeans burned the king&rsquo;s house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and brake down the walls of Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon&rsquo;s princes;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; Now the word of the L<span>ord</span> came unto Jeremiah, while he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be <i>accomplished</i> in that day before thee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the L<span>ord</span>: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou <i>art</i> afraid.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter40" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 40</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>THE word that came to Jeremiah from the L<span>ord</span>, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, which were carried away captive unto Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The L<span>ord</span> thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Now the L<span>ord</span> hath brought <i>it</i>, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the L<span>ord</span>, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which <i>were</i> upon thine hand. If it seem good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seem ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land <i>is</i> before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Now while he was not yet gone back, <i>he</i> <i>said</i>, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon hath made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wheresoever it seemeth convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Then went Jeremiah unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 &para; Now when all the captains of the forces which <i>were</i> in the fields, <i>even</i> they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan sware unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put <i>them</i> in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Likewise when all the Jews that <i>were</i> in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that <i>were</i> in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Then Johanan the son of Kareah spake to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know <i>it:</i> wherefore should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered, and the remnant in Judah perish?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>NOW it came to pass in the seventh month, <i>that</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they did eat bread together in Mizpah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, <i>even</i> with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, <i>and</i> the men of war.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew <i>it</i>,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 That there came certain from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, <i>even</i> fourscore men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring <i>them</i> to the house of the L<span>ord</span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 And it was <i>so</i>, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, <i>and</i> <i>cast</i> <i>them</i> into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that <i>were</i> with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbare, and slew them not among their brethren.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Now the pit wherein Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, <i>was</i> it which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: <i>and</i> Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with <i>them</i> <i>that</i> <i>were</i> slain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that <i>were</i> in Mizpah, <i>even</i> the king&rsquo;s daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 &para; But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that <i>were</i> with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that <i>are</i> in Gibeon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, <i>and</i> to serve other gods, whom they knew not, <i>neither</i> they, ye, nor your fathers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 So that the L<span>ord</span> could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, <i>and</i> because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the L<span>ord</span>, and have not obeyed the voice of the L<span>ord</span>, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away <i>on</i> the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>57 And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise <i>men</i>, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name <i>is</i> the L<span>ord</span> of hosts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>58 Thus saith the L<span>ord</span> of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>59 &para; The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And <i>this</i> Seraiah <i>was</i> a quiet prince.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>60 So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, <i>even</i> all these words that are written against Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>61 And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>62 Then shalt thou say, O L<span>ord</span>, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>63 And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, <i>that</i> thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>64 And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far <i>are</i> the words of Jeremiah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter52" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 52</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>ZEDEKIAH <i>was</i> one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name <i>was</i> Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And he did <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>was</i> evil in the eyes of the L<span>ord</span>, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For through the anger of the L<span>ord</span> it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 &para; And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and pitched against it, and built forts against it round about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 And in the fourth month, in the ninth <i>day</i> of the month, the famine was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which <i>was</i> by the king&rsquo;s garden; (now the Chaldeans <i>were</i> by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 &para; But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Then they took the king, and carried him up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Now in the fifth month, in the tenth <i>day</i> of the month, which <i>was</i> the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, <i>which</i> served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 And burned the house of the L<span>ord</span>, and the king&rsquo;s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great <i>men</i>, burned he with fire:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And all the army of the Chaldeans, that <i>were</i> with the captain of the guard, brake down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive <i>certain</i> of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left <i>certain</i> of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Also the pillars of brass that <i>were</i> in the house of the L<span>ord</span>, and the bases, and the brasen sea that <i>was</i> in the house of the L<span>ord</span>, the Chaldeans brake, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they ministered, took they away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 And the basons, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> of gold <i>in</i> gold, and <i>that</i> which <i>was</i> of silver <i>in</i> silver, took the captain of the guard away.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that <i>were</i> under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the L<span>ord</span>: the brass of all these vessels was without weight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>21 And <i>concerning</i> the pillars, the height of one pillar <i>was</i> eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof <i>was</i> four fingers: <i>it</i> <i>was</i> hollow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>22 And a chapiter of brass <i>was</i> upon it; and the height of one chapiter <i>was</i> five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all <i>of</i> brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates <i>were</i> like unto these.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>23 And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; <i>and</i> all the pomegranates upon the network <i>were</i> an hundred round about.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>24 &para; And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>25 He took also out of the city an eunuch, which had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king&rsquo;s person, which were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and threescore men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>26 So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>27 And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>28 This <i>is</i> the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>29 In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>30 In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons <i>were</i> four thousand and six hundred.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>31 &para; And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the <i>first</i> year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>32 And spake kindly unto him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that <i>were</i> with him in Babylon,</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>33 And changed his prison garments: and he did continually eat bread before him all the days of his life.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span>34 And <i>for</i> his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life.</span> </p>
