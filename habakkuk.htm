<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter1" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! <i>even</i> cry out unto thee <i>of</i> violence, and thou wilt not save!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause <i>me</i> to behold grievance? for spoiling and violence <i>are</i> before me: and there are <i>that</i> raise up strife and contention.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for <i>I</i> will work a work in your days, <i>which</i> ye will not believe, though it be told <i>you</i>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, <i>that</i> bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces <i>that</i> <i>are</i> not theirs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 They <i>are</i> terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle <i>that</i> hasteth to eat.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up <i>as</i> the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 Then shall <i>his</i> mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, <i>imputing</i> this his power unto his god.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; <i>Art</i> thou not from everlasting, O L<span class="lord">ord</span> my God, mine Holy One? we shall not die. O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 <i>Thou</i> <i>art</i> of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, <i>and</i> holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth <i>the</i> <i>man</i> <i>that</i> <i>is</i> more righteous than he?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, <i>that</i> <i>have</i> no ruler over them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion <i>is</i> fat, and their meat plenteous.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter2" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 2</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 And the L<span class="lord">ord</span> answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make <i>it</i> plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 For the vision <i>is</i> yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 Behold, his soul <i>which</i> is lifted up is not upright in him: but the just shall live by his faith.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 &para; Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, <i>he</i> <i>is</i> a proud man, neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and <i>is</i> as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that increaseth <i>that</i> <i>which</i> <i>is</i> not his! how long? and to him that ladeth himself with thick clay!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the people shall spoil thee; because of men&rsquo;s blood, and <i>for</i> the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 &para; Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house, that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many people, and hast sinned <i>against</i> thy soul.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 &para; Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a city by iniquity!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Behold, <i>is</i> <i>it</i> not of the L<span class="lord">ord</span> of hosts that the people shall labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves for very vanity?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, as the waters cover the sea.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 &para; Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy bottle to <i>him</i>, and makest <i>him</i> drunken also, that thou mayest look on their nakedness!</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the L<span class="lord">ord</span>&rsquo;s right hand shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> on thy glory.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of beasts, <i>which</i> made them afraid, because of men&rsquo;s blood, and for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 &para; What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it <i>is</i> laid over with gold and silver, and <i>there</i> <i>is</i> no breath at all in the midst of it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>20 But the L<span class="lord">ord</span> <i>is</i> in his holy temple: let all the earth keep silence before him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" id="chapter3" class="chapter"><span>CHAPTER 3</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>1 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>2 O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, I have heard thy speech, <i>and</i> was afraid: O L<span class="lord">ord</span>, revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>3 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>4 And <i>his</i> brightness was as the light; he had horns <i>coming</i> out of his hand: and there <i>was</i> the hiding of his power.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>5 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>6 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways <i>are</i> everlasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>7 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: <i>and</i> the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>8 Was the L<span class="lord">ord</span> displeased against the rivers? <i>was</i> thine anger against the rivers? <i>was</i> thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses <i>and</i> thy chariots of salvation?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>9 Thy bow was made quite naked, <i>according</i> to the oaths of the tribes, <i>even</i> <i>thy</i> word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with rivers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>10 The mountains saw thee, <i>and</i> they trembled: the overflowing of the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, <i>and</i> lifted up his hands on high.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>11 The sun <i>and</i> moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, <i>and</i> at the shining of thy glittering spear.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>12 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst thresh the heathen in anger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>13 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, <i>even</i> for salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>14 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing <i>was</i> as to devour the poor secretly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>15 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, <i>through</i> the heap of great waters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>16 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his troops.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>17 &para; Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither <i>shall</i> fruit <i>be</i> in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and <i>there</i> <i>shall</i> <i>be</i> no herd in the stalls:</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" data-ke-size="size16"><span>18 Yet I will rejoice in the L<span class="lord">ord</span>, I will joy in the God of my salvation.</span></p>
<p data-ke-size="size16"><span>19 The L<span class="lord">ord</span> God <i>is</i> my strength, and he will make my feet like hinds&rsquo; <i>feet</i>, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.</span> </p>
